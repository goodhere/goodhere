Decided to implement automatic data scraping backend as a customly built system deployed on Heroku, rather than using
a specialized platform for scraping such as Apify, because we think that the backend system will eventually outgrow mere
data scraping.

See [this message](https://github.com/climatescape/climatescape.org/issues/40#issuecomment-583264142) and the preceding
messages in the thread.
