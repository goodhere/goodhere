Decided to use Node.JS platform for the backend system ([deployed in Heroku](1-use-heroku.md)) for two main reasons:
 - This is a platform familiar to the key stakeholder of the project, Brendan.
 - Uniformity with the frontend (Netlify) part of the project and potentially sharing some model code in the future.
