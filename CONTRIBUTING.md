### Submitting code
**Note:** We recommend you raise an issue on Github or start a conversation on our [Community Forum](https://goodhere.discourse.group/) about the change you want to make before you start on code.

1. Read our [Development Workflow](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/workflow.md) to understand how we work, and review our [Code Style Guide](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/style-guide.md) before you begin.
2. Before you submit a pull request, please make sure your contribution passes all tests. Test failures need to be addressed before we can merge your contribution.
3. Provide detail about the issue you are solving in the pull request description. Note: If your pull request addresses a specific issue, please reference it using medic/<repo>#<issue number>
4. Our CI will automatically schedule a build; monitor the build to ensure it passes.
5. Your PR will be reviewed by one of the repository's maintainers. Most PRs have at least one change requested before they're merged so don't be offended if your change doesn't get accepted on the first try!

### Improving our documentation

### Disclosing vulnerabilities

We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the security community. The disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.

#### Guidelines

We require that all contributors:

- Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing;
- Refrain from using any in-scope compromise as a platform to probe or conduct additional research, on any other system, regardless of scope;
- Perform research only within the scope set out below;
- Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us; and
- Keep information about any vulnerabilities you've discovered confidential between yourself and Medic Mobile until all production systems have been patched.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:

- Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours of submission);
- Recognize your contribution on our Security Researcher Hall of Fame, if you are the first to report the issue and we make a code or configuration change based on the issue.


#### How to report a security vulnerability?

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in one of our products or platforms please send it to us by emailing hello@goodhere.org. Please include the following details with your report:

- Description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability;
- A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (proof of concept source code, screenshots, and compressed screen captures are all helpful to us); and
- Your name/handle and a link for recognition in our Hall of Fame.
