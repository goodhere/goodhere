/**
 * This method is like Object.assign, but recursively merges own and inherited
 * enumerable keyed properties of source objects into the destination object.
 *
 * NOTE: this behaves like lodash/merge, but:
 * - does mutate functions if they are a source
 * - treats non-plain objects as plain
 * - does not work for circular objects
 * - treats sparse arrays as sparse
 * - does not convert Array-like objects (Arguments, NodeLists, etc.) to arrays
 *
 * @param {Object} object The destination object.
 * @param {...Object} [sources] The source objects.
 * @returns {Object} Returns `object`.
