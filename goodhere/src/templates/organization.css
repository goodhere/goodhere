 * We do not have a space-evenly class name with tailwind (see https: //github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/pull/22).
 * Uses space-evenly instead of justify-content: space-around; to render better on most browsers (except edge)
 * In lg we do not need a justify-content. There is no need to override it.
