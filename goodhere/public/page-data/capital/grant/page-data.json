Our goal is to encourage as many philanthropists as possible to join our tribe – 1% of annual grantmaking from U.S. private foundations alone would eclipse traditional venture capital for climate-relevant companies globally.\n\nPrime ’s long-term success will be measured by our portfolio companies’ impact on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.
