","About":"Energy models are widely used for policy advice and research. They serve to help answer questions on energy policy, decarbonization, and transitions towards renewable energy sources. Currently, most energy models are black boxes – even to fellow researchers.\n\n“Open” refers to model source code that can be studied, changed and improved as well as freely available energy system data.\n\nWe believe that more openness in energy modelling increases transparency and credibility, reduces wasteful double-work and improves overall quality. This allows the community to advance the research frontier and gain the highest benefit from energy modelling for society.\n\nWe, energy modelers from various institutions, want to promote the idea and practice of open energy modeling among fellow modelers, research institutions, funding bodies, and recipients of our work.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":null,"Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://openmod-initiative.org/","LinkedIn":null,"Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services","Network"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"65fa3a2f-5983-5ab9-8e30-201aba580a51","data":{"Name":"International","Parent":null}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"21921b21-d503-5b5b-aa4a-31692662a9e5"}}}
