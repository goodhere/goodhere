Headquartered in Mexico City, Sistema.bio promotes a world where waste is a resource, and farmers are empowered and productive. We manufacture, sell, install and finance our patented biodigester systems for small and medium-scale farmers to convert their waste into economic, health and environmental benefits.\n\nBy the end of 2021, our goal is to have installed biodigesters for over 200,000 people in 15 countries where they lack access to clean, renewable and cost-effective energy. \n\nSistema.bio is the 2019 Ashden Clean cooking Awards winner and the 2017 Buckminster Fuller Institute Finalist. Our Founder Alex Eaton is an Ashoka and Endeavor Fellow.","HQ_Locality":"Roma Norte","HQ_Region":"Mexico City","HQ_Country":"Mexico","Headcount":"51-200","Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"http://sistema.bio","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/sistema-biobolsa/","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/sistema_bio","Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/Sistema.bio/","Crunchbase":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sistema-bio","Role":null,"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/1d7429b7a478781be67d80c6183ea776/sistema.bio-3.jpeg"},{"publicURL":"/static/325ab5110d5cc0b25747099a11ae2828/sistema.bio-11.jpeg"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/c835bfc085fcaa5e5ea6f02cc4747969/09d8f/Imagefromwww.linkedin.comon2020-02-04at10.08.33AM.jpg"}}}]}}}],"Crunchbase_ODM":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/ad26e82edd659c66425ccbefc98e73be/09d8f/cuogluxysroubhob6i0d.jpg"}}}]}}}],"Categories":null,"Source":[{"data":{"Name":"Climate Tech List","URL":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12xd_rY-WJo_QDxTkD1BfxzX9P4CwWCV5tAic7ELp4fo/edit#gid=0"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a13085b0-9c04-5491-909d-b81838ab6ff9"}}}
