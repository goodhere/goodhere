","About":"The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) advances high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment. ARPA-E awardees are unique because they are developing entirely new ways to generate, store, and use energy.\n\nARPA-E projects have the potential to radically improve U.S. economic prosperity, national security, and environmental well being. We focus on transformational energy projects that can be meaningfully advanced with a small amount of funding over a defined period of time. Our streamlined awards process enables us to act quickly and catalyze cutting-edge areas of energy research.\n\nARPA-E empowers America's energy researchers with funding, technical assistance, and market readiness. Our rigorous program design, competitive project selection process, and active program management ensure thoughtful expenditures. ARPA-E Program Directors serve for limited terms to ensure a constant infusion of fresh thinking and new perspectives.","HQ_Locality":"Washington, D.C.","HQ_Region":"Washington, D.C.","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":"51-200","Organization_Type":"Governmental","Homepage":"https://arpa-e.energy.gov/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/advanced-research-projects-agency-energy-arpa-e-/","Twitter":"http://twitter.com/ARPAE","Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/arpaegov?ref=ts","Crunchbase":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arpa-e","Role":["Research & Development","Capital"],"Capital_Profile":[{"data":{"ImpactSpecific":null,"Strategic":null,"Stage":null,"CheckSize":["$250k-1M","$1M-10M"],"CapitalType":[{"data":{"Name":"Grants"}}]}}],"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/20d51c131aed2a4d1c18b8c775fd358e/09d8f/Office_of_the_Chief_Counsel_for_ARPA-E__Department_of_Energy.jpg"}}}]},"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/085dd661e55acbd67a8211ecb25ce7ee/91bed/4eaeadb34f83342a634b7f4d43d61e01.png"}}}]}}}],"Categories":null,"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4aee8ca1-e74a-5ba7-9630-eaedcde52025"}}}
