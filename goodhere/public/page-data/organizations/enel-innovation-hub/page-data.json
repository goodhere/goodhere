The ideas and projects are selected directly by the Group’s Global Business Lines, therefore the startups are able to collaborate directly with a partner that can offer solid support in the development of technological solutions and new business models.\n\nEnel works as an industrial partner, enabling startups, SME’s and the innovation communities to benefit from the Group’s expertise through access to laboratories, internal and external experts, plants and, above all, customers and data. Enel finances the tests and the co-developed projects and also makes available to the startups the Group’s own network of contacts with leading investors and sources of finance from around the world.\n\nOnce the test phase has been completed, the solutions and the new business models are scaled up to an international level, making full use of Enel’s plants, networks and customer base around the world.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":null,"Organization_Type":"Public","Homepage":"https://startup.enel.com/en/innovation-hub.html","LinkedIn":null,"Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Capital"],"Capital_Profile":[{"data":{"ImpactSpecific":null,"Strategic":true,"Stage":null,"CheckSize":null,"CapitalType":[{"data":{"Name":"Incubators"}}]}}],"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"65fa3a2f-5983-5ab9-8e30-201aba580a51","data":{"Name":"Energy","Parent":null}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a7486b0d-74e6-583e-b993-59f5b9fb3627"}}}
