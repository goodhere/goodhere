Using a distributed ledger and modern remote sensing technology, our team is creating new tools for how humanity relates to its environment.\n\nWe are creating the peer to peer infrastructure that allows anyone to propose a protocol for the accurate measurement of specific environmental outcomes. We then invite existing academic and scientific communities to comment and upgrade those proposals. Over time, there will be hundreds of different, well accepted, scientifically robust protocols for understanding, with a high degree of accuracy, the ecological impact on any specific piece of land.
