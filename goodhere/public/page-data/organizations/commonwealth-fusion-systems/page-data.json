Yet, in the past, even state-of-the art superconducting magnet technology required tokamaks to be enormous to produce net fusion energy. Recently, a new high temperature superconductor has reached industrial maturity. CFS is using these high temperature superconductors to build smaller and lower-cost tokamak fusion systems. CFS will build first-of-its-kind high temperature superconducting magnets, followed by the worldâ€™s first net energy-producing fusion machine, called SPARC. SPARC will pave the way for the first commercially viable fusion power plant, ARC.","HQ_Locality":"Cambridge","HQ_Region":"Massachusetts","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":"1-10","Organization_Type":"Private","Homepage":"https://www.cfs.energy/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/commonwealth-fusion-systems/","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/CFS_energy","Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/commonwealth-fusion-systems","Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/b9ff0b690d35121838e376dfa9e4c475/09d8f/06.jpg"}}}]},"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/b59331f7bc62b3c2c254df50e6e37ea5/www.cfs.energy-9.jpeg"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/f4db04120b5140625819f70c92a1aefc/91bed/nasdz5ghh4uee2yh6jag.png"}}}]}}}],"Categories":[{"id":"4839bcf1-19ec-5213-b5b6-91d148fba24c","data":{"Name":"Nuclear","Parent":[{"id":"65fa3a2f-5983-5ab9-8e30-201aba580a51","data":{"Name":"International"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5052e263-df41-5b9c-b8ac-946c7fc9bee0"}}}
