WSE is currently developing a world first project utilising its unique unidirectional Oscillating Water Column technology at King Island, Tasmania. Construction is nearing completion, with the unit expected to be operational by mid 2020. The technology has several applications in addition to conventional energy generation.These applications include displacing diesel in remote island locations, producing hydrogen, producing desalinated water and acting as a form of protection against coastal erosion. The WSE technology is expected to play an important role in Australia and the worldâ€™s efforts to combat climate change.","HQ_Locality":"Melbourne","HQ_Region":"Victoria","HQ_Country":"Australia","Headcount":"1-10","Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://www.waveswell.com/","LinkedIn":null,"Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wave-swell","Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/39e96a0d01ac6ed49cf31415b25a6ef6/www.waveswell.com-5.jpeg"},{"publicURL":"/static/97f4e1a2bc8e6415d15d28f0bf54cffc/www.waveswell.com-7.jpeg"},{"publicURL":"/static/9d0a9d2063ad2c84d6533959dd571f3d/www.waveswell.com-8.jpeg"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/113c63ea023b8baa51b02953b166c81c/91bed/Imagefromwww.linkedin.comon2020-03-27at6.59.27PM.png"}}}]}}}],"Crunchbase_ODM":[{"data":{"Logo":null}}],"Categories":[{"id":"dde828e2-45ea-5f97-b157-e9ac48191b5b","data":{"Name":"Wave Energy","Parent":[{"id":"65fa3a2f-5983-5ab9-8e30-201aba580a51","data":{"Name":"Energy"}}]}}],"Source":[{"data":{"Name":"Climate Tech List","URL":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12xd_rY-WJo_QDxTkD1BfxzX9P4CwWCV5tAic7ELp4fo/edit#gid=0"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c9c59a3a-627e-58df-8b06-2f492346c778"}}}
