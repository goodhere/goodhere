The world needs clean, reliable, carbon-free energy solutions, so that we can power our planet without destroying it.\n\nIS THIS ADVANCED NUCLEAR?\n\nYes, new implementations of fission and fusion will likely be critical components of the carbon-free electric grid of the future. Advanced reactors, designed by a new generation of nuclear engineers, solve the problems facing conventional designs while increasing safety and resiliency.\n\nA BRIGHTER FUTURE IS POSSIBLE\n\nWe believe that the next generation of nuclear reactors will be smaller, safer, more efficient, and more cost-effective. Modular and easily installed systems will provide reliable, low-cost power, helping the world thrive by disrupting demand for carbon-emitting fossil fuels.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":null,"Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://nucleationcapital.com/","LinkedIn":null,"Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Capital"],"Capital_Profile":[{"data":{"ImpactSpecific":null,"Strategic":null,"Stage":null,"CheckSize":null,"CapitalType":[{"data":{"Name":"Venture Capital"}}]}}],"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/180b6d6e536a360a4c695c2576d6c977/91bed/ScreenShot2020-03-27at1_16_04PM.png"}}}]},"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/580c8614c00c954dfe8942e18f3459de/ScreenShot2020-03-27at2_34_19PM.png"},{"publicURL":"/static/740352ef4b48bf9bd5ac04af56cde9f5/ScreenShot2020-03-27at2_34_14PM.png"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"65fa3a2f-5983-5ab9-8e30-201aba580a51","data":{"Name":"International","Parent":null}},{"id":"4839bcf1-19ec-5213-b5b6-91d148fba24c","data":{"Name":"Nuclear","Parent":[{"id":"65fa3a2f-5983-5ab9-8e30-201aba580a51","data":{"Name":"International"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c47c0ee7-7078-5613-8ab9-ca3d62824c43"}}}
