Using beaches to speed up olivine rock weathering to remove gigaton levels of CO2.","About":"The accelerated weathering of olivine is the only method we are aware of to remove CO2 from the atmosphere that is viable with todayâ€™s technology, can be done at a reasonable price, and that is scalable to the gigaton level.\n\nOur plan is to put this process into action to demonstrate to the world that carbon removal is possible and that it is well past the time we start. Operating as a non-profit, Project Vesta seeks to create a global network of green sand beaches to counter-act the entirety of the total yearly CO2 outputs by humans (and eventually back to pre-industrial levels).","HQ_Locality":"San Francisco","HQ_Region":"California","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":"1-10","Organization_Type":"Nonprofit","Homepage":"https://projectvesta.org/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/projectvesta/","Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/716d1139baca8b75c850462850ae7a78/91bed/090.png"}}}]},"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/11a833ef1cfba1ec3a187eea32efd5f0/projectvesta.org-4.png"},{"publicURL":"/static/dafaae97440f0befdf72a0f4d95af1d6/projectvesta.org-8.png"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"9776d659-e7c6-54e1-9551-6ab1f7fb69a5","data":{"Name":"Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)","Parent":[{"id":"3739898c-dc58-57eb-b31d-83dd96e55529","data":{"Name":"Carbon"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"12cc0b8f-57fb-5fb4-a4f8-303aeb574d79"}}}
