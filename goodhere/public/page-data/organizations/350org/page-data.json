Our online campaigns, grassroots organizing, and mass public actions are led from the bottom up by thousands of volunteer organizers in over 188 countries. 350.org works hard to organize in a new wayâ€”everywhere at once, using online tools to facilitate strategic offline action. We want to be a laboratory for the best ways to strengthen the climate movement and catalyze transformation around the world.\r\n\r\n350.org is a growing global organization incorporated and based in the United States, with staff currently working in 23 countries around the globe. 350.org is on a rapid growth trajectory, having grown our budget 400% since we incorporated in 2011. We seek ever more opportunities to galvanize the public to respond to the threat of climate change. This is due to two factors: scientific evidence of the threat of the problem and severity of impacts, and the success we have had in mobilization, creative communications, and organizing. Looking to the future, we believe aggressive political action on climate change can happen, but creating the political space for that change will push us to work more creatively, smartly, and quickly than ever before.\r\n\r\nOur organisation is comprised of energetic, passionate, and disciplined change-makers.  We are known for our sophisticated use of technology and our distributed organizing, mass mobilization, and connections to other social movements. We love Skype emoticons, customized Spotify playlists, open-office formats with newspaper clippings on the walls, and marching in the streets.","HQ_Locality":"Brooklyn","HQ_Region":"New York","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":"51-200","Organization_Type":"Nonprofit","Homepage":"https://350.org/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/350-org/","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/350","Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/350.org","Crunchbase":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/350-org","Role":["Advocacy"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/f6bb923e1afc9a9b28bae208c16b7e3a/350.org-5.jpeg"},{"publicURL":"/static/c0134b886852f536de8875f6d5779a77/350.org-6.jpeg"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/4a2e0210db7d0faf6302657067b048fa/91bed/Imagefromwww.linkedin.comon2020-02-03at11.28.33PM.png"}}}]}}}],"Crunchbase_ODM":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/5c420717e78d18e5caf2fd38228bb704/91bed/tb1jmbsbuzmajgkprysr.png"}}}]}}}],"Categories":[{"id":"3739898c-dc58-57eb-b31d-83dd96e55529","data":{"Name":"Carbon","Parent":null}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"09faf382-c86c-5f04-bee0-f87de3ad010e"}}}
