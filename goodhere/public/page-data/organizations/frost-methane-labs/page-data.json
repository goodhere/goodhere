We do this because we believe that urgent action is needed to preserve both our planet's biodiversity and our most sensitive communities.\n\nFrost Methane exists to identify, flare, and monitor concentrated methane seeps in Arctic permafrost and around the world. This approach has the potential to offset 1% of global human emissions, adding to the scientific dataset of methane release in the process. We earn revenue through carbon offset markets, which we re-invest into future deployments, building a global network of self-sustaining devices to combat climate change.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":"1-10","Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://www.frostmethane.com/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/frost-methane-labs/","Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/c3750d9ae5e9c3ec6f8c259c66215268/91bed/Imagefromwww.linkedin.comon2020-03-26at7.55.11PM.png"}}}]}}}],"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"998dbe8d-314c-59e4-a797-b8af97553c3a","data":{"Name":"Carbon Offsets","Parent":[{"id":"3739898c-dc58-57eb-b31d-83dd96e55529","data":{"Name":"Carbon"}}]}},{"id":"926dd62c-0fb7-58cd-b3c1-3b7253f751c3","data":{"Name":"Arctic Methane Release","Parent":[{"id":"dee6e86a-5708-5b76-99bd-6255cb50906f","data":{"Name":"Climate Risk"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0dad0e0a-9dcf-538b-b4df-2b05644321cf"}}}
