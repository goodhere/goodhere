But we humans are wired to seek approval, to want to be popular. And that is precisely why so few of us are successful entrepreneurs. To build a massively successful business - you have to be comfortable with being unpopular. You have to go where no one else goes, to make decisions that some people don't like, and to push forward with conviction even when there's no one to cheer you on.\n\n\nUnpopular Ventures is dedicated to the entrepreneurs who are proud to be unpopular. We love opportunities that are off the beaten path, particularly when they are led by outstanding teams who have discovered something surprising. Our favorite companies are the ones with ideas that seem easy to dismiss, and yet there is a hidden, under-served group of customers who absolutely love them.\n\n\nWe have invested >$9 M across 29 companies since we started in early 2019.
