Our work therefore is an open source public good and falls into three workstreams.","HQ_Locality":"London","HQ_Region":"England","HQ_Country":"United Kingdom","Headcount":"11-50","Organization_Type":"Nonprofit","Homepage":"https://www.climatebonds.net/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/climate-bonds-initiative/","Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services","Research & Development"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/a432e33a39c680a3b1ffd30399b24a7f/09d8f/04.jpg"}}}]},"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":null,"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3fa73047-0619-5d54-962b-62c2d6d3a1a4"}}}
