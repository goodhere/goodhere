Together with NRG and partners, we designed, developed, and fabricated the first  “shoe without a footprint” for the launch of COSIA’s Carbon XPRIZE.\n\nThe Carbon XPRIZE is a $20 Million global competition hosted by NRG to inspire the development of breakthrough technologies that convert CO₂ emissions into valuable assets like building materials, alternative fuels, and consumer products we use every day.\n\nTo kick off the competition, 10XBeta was commissioned to create a sneaker that showcased how consumer products could benefit from the use of recycled CO₂ at the object, system, and materials level. The process required extensive material science and biochemistry research, as well as support from partners in shoe and fashion design, sourcing, and manufacturing.","HQ_Locality":"Brooklyn","HQ_Region":"New York","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":"11-50","Organization_Type":"Private","Homepage":"https://www.10xbeta.com/footprintless","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/10xbeta","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/10xbeta","Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/5689f54c145dad44f3aca28ff41183af/91bed/981AB401-26BE-45B4-9EE4-4F30B6D720B9.png"}}}]},"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"2249860d-9f58-556f-84c2-06e6776ea4f4","data":{"Name":"Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU)","Parent":[{"id":"3739898c-dc58-57eb-b31d-83dd96e55529","data":{"Name":"Community Development"}}]}},{"id":"3739898c-dc58-57eb-b31d-83dd96e55529","data":{"Name":"Community Development","Parent":null}},{"id":"4d020148-cff1-535d-a659-4ca59813b3c4","data":{"Name":"Family & Social Services","Parent":null}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a501e83c-3efb-5eaa-9dff-19bbf55efe97"}}}
