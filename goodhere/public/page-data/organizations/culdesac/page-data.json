We’re bringing together services like ridesharing, bikes and scooters, and same-day grocery delivery, so zero private cars means zero hassle. Plus, an on-site light rail stop makes it a breeze to get downtown for work.","HQ_Locality":"San Francisco","HQ_Region":"California","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":"11-50","Organization_Type":"Private","Homepage":"https://culdesac.com","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/liveculdesac/","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/liveculdesac","Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/culdesac-f070","Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/0ce0a17823804c2ecd63c3eccfaa6515/09d8f/08.jpg"}}}]},"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/8a589d382005b934e9e2ea36e6856081/09d8f/gepm4tdazte6pklnltwe.jpg"}}}]}}}],"Categories":[{"id":"2a3c79ca-a413-5995-b947-9b1b2cd47a6e","data":{"Name":"Arts & Culture","Parent":null}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3ed6d717-f627-56ec-a22d-48a80fcf8dbf"}}}
