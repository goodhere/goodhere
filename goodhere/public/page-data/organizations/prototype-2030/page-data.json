We believe wind-farms can be beautiful, energy storage can be cool, and insulation can be inspiring - if we let go of the current focus on ‘design by spreadsheet’. If we do that, we can turn resistance into irresistible.  \n\nWe intend to apply this approach in our individual professional practices, but reality can move slowly. So that’s why we created Prototype 2030 - as a playground, where we want to give the world a taste of what’s possible. \n\nAs much as we love this project, we hope it will be obsolete long before 2030. We hope by then it will have become common practice to have designers and other creatives at the table in climate solution projects. Until then, we hope to inspire through these pages, and invite you to reach out with any questions or feedback.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":"1-10","Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://www.prototype2030.org/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/prototype2030/","Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services","Network"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/4cf7e7fd8983db1061adc0a8526a13de/09d8f/Imagefromwww.linkedin.comon2020-03-26at8.03.44PM.jpg"}}}]}}}],"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":null,"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ab431c2c-73a8-52a3-8e35-a92d06633f6d"}}}
