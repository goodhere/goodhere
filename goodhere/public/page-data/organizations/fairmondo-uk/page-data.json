Our aim is simple: to make it easy to find the ethical online from an ethical business. Aggregating ethical sellers and goods in one marketplace and creating a brand that becomes synonymous with the best in this sector. We are a part of a global movement of co-operative businesses (starting with fairmondo.de, Germany 2012) connecting the local and working to create a new kind of transparent, democratic, open & participatory Internet.\n\nFairmondo UK is the trading name of Worth Cooperating Ltd, a workers co-operative. We describe ourselves as a bunch of citizen activists who asked ‘why isn’t there a co-operative version of Amazon or eBay?’. Collectively we have a set of social media marketing, networking, coding, project management, management and people skills. Rather deficient in everything but prepared to have a go.\n","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":null,"Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://www.fairmondo.uk/","LinkedIn":null,"Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/217bf41e447f531fb79974433dd25eb9/www.fairmondo.uk-8.jpeg"},{"publicURL":"/static/3764ddb8f223bd53ce0e666ca6b124c6/www.fairmondo.uk-10.png"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"4d020148-cff1-535d-a659-4ca59813b3c4","data":{"Name":"Family & Social Services","Parent":null}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"003a0b65-1639-52e2-bb28-896734f89acc"}}}
