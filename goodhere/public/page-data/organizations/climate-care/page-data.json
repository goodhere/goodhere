We helped shape the first voluntary carbon markets, and pioneered the use of carbon finance for community-based development projects.\n\nIn 2007, we achieved our first 1 million tonnes of CO2 reductions, and were acquired by investment bank J.P. Morgan the following year. In 2011, ClimateCare bought the business back. Since then, we’ve deployed over $100 million, working with our partners to create positive social and environmental outcomes.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":null,"Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://climatecare.org/","LinkedIn":null,"Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/3d6458550ffbb281906602f248875554/climatecare.org-11.jpeg"},{"publicURL":"/static/d841bfa2638ab7c8d394c33cf52bb904/climatecare.org-10.jpeg"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"998dbe8d-314c-59e4-a797-b8af97553c3a","data":{"Name":"Carbon Offsets","Parent":[{"id":"3739898c-dc58-57eb-b31d-83dd96e55529","data":{"Name":"Community Development"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cff3590a-123c-5e76-850c-311ef5165bf2"}}}
