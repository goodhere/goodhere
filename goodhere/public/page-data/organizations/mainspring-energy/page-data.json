The patented design and adaptive control enable high efficiency, near-zero NOx emissions, full dispatchability, and seamless switching between renewable fuels such as biogas and nonrenewable fuels such as natural gas and propane.\n\nMainspring’s linear generator products combine grid-tie inverters and auxiliaries into turn-key packages for fast and simple installation. Mainspring’s first product is designed for commercial businesses with a rated output of 250 kW net AC (3-phase, 480 V) and packaged in a standard 20’ container. Future products designed for industrial businesses, data centers, hospitals, smart cities, and utilities will offer higher power output.\n\nMainspring (formerly EtaGen) was founded in 2010 by three Stanford engineers researching new technologies to improve the efficiency of distributed power generation. Since its founding, the company has successfully built and tested three generations of linear generators in preparation for commercial and industrial deployment. Mainspring will enter the market in 2020 with Fortune 100 customers and top-tier strategic partners.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":"51-200","Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"www.mainspringenergy.com","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/mainspringenergy/about/","Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/f6752b822a69e641b7c6c75a3f9d4d5c/91bed/Imagefromwww.linkedin.comon2020-03-26at7.59.30PM.png"}}}]}}}],"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"65fa3a2f-5983-5ab9-8e30-201aba580a51","data":{"Name":"International","Parent":null}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"32542dfb-bb73-5e7d-ab20-e164ee66b368"}}}
