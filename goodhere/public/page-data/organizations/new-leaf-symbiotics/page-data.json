Our team works with partners worldwide to discover and activate the potential of plants by using the tools nature gave us. We develop products based exclusively on a new class of Ag Biologicals called M-trophs (Pink Pigmented Facultative Methylotrophs — one of the most abundant types of beneficial native microbes in the world).\n\nM-trophs are bio-complements that function in harmony with existing technologies and agricultural practices. We believe that’s the key to sustainable agriculture. Better together.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":null,"Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://newleafsym.com/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/newleaf-symbiotics-inc-","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/NewLeaf_Sym","Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/bc9cd4ab722580d0aff9cee1271b3c07/newleaf-logo.png"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"46012848-60cf-5524-adab-72736ac2d8e6","data":{"Name":"Farming","Parent":[{"id":"cc823ed3-5cb7-59c0-9bd1-2ddd3861e822","data":{"Name":"Human & Civil Rights"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"36b88675-efce-5e4e-8217-0350cccf020a"}}}
