QCD provides valuable baseline information, which we anonymize, aggregate, and analyze to improve climate change models and calculations.\nEach time you bike, walk or take mass transit CODEX calculates the QAC as a result of your actions.\n\nLets say you drive to work on Mondays, and then bike and take public transit the rest of the week. Each day, CODEX automatically senses your mode of transport, calculates your emissions, and generates carbon offsets whenever you choose to use low carbon transport. As your QCD decreases, our app calculates and attributes the resulting QAC to you.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":null,"Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://carboncodex.app/","LinkedIn":null,"Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"3eac198c-c145-5fb8-a278-45988f967f3a","data":{"Name":"Carbon Accounting","Parent":[{"id":"3739898c-dc58-57eb-b31d-83dd96e55529","data":{"Name":"Carbon"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c70c179a-448f-550b-b418-301dd9b01b78"}}}
