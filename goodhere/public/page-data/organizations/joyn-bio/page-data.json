By engineering crop-colonizing microbes, we can develop a new class of biologicals that are sustainable and reach unprecedented levels of performance and reliability.\n\nMicrobes have evolved alongside plants and contributed to their growth by helping them efficiently access nutrients and protect against pests and diseases. We are plant scientists, microbiologists, synthetic biologists, and data scientists looking to the plant microbiome to drive the development of better and more sustainable solutions for today's farmers.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":"11-50","Organization_Type":"Private","Homepage":"https://joynbio.com/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/joyn-bio","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/joynbio","Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/JoynBio","Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services","Research & Development"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/8b402088ad1dec19cacbad9b858b8909/91bed/ScreenShot2020-04-28at12.04.20PM.png"}}}]},"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"46012848-60cf-5524-adab-72736ac2d8e6","data":{"Name":"Farming","Parent":[{"id":"cc823ed3-5cb7-59c0-9bd1-2ddd3861e822","data":{"Name":"Food & Agriculture"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c7797015-3edc-5664-a832-d35e3cdc37ec"}}}
