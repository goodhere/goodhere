They are where we wake up each morning and go to work each day, where our children learn and grow, and where we spend time with our friends and family. Where we live can influence our health, our economic potential, and our children’s futures.\n\nEveryone in America—no matter his or her age, ability, income, or race—deserves the option to live somewhere affordable, convenient, beautiful, and safe. And America’s towns and cities deserve investment, stewardship, and supportive, thriving communities. A smart growth approach to development is about creating the places that make this possible.\n\nSmart growth means reinvesting in America’s downtowns and Main Streets, the economic engines of big cities and small towns alike. Smart growth means creating homes for families of all income levels alongside one another. Smart growth means diversifying our transportation system so Americans have a choice in how they get around. Smart growth means building streets that are safe for people walking, bicycling or using a wheelchair, as well as driving. Smart growth means reimagining the places we have already built, and protecting our open green spaces for generations to come.\n\nAbove all, smart growth is about helping every town and city become a more economically prosperous, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable place to live. This approach looks different for every community, but can help neighborhoods of any kind flourish, make towns and cities competitive in a 21st century economy, and improve lives by improving neighborhoods.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":null,"Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://smartgrowthamerica.org/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/smart-growth-america","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/SmartGrowthUSA","Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Network"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"2a3c79ca-a413-5995-b947-9b1b2cd47a6e","data":{"Name":"Arts & Culture","Parent":null}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c430987a-3690-54f7-9ce0-79f637d3ba04"}}}
