The wood waste is sourced from sustainable FSC certified forests. Our manufacturing process is closed-loop and a circular system. No external energy is required to run the equipment, and our process does not emit any CO2 or other greenhouse gases. Nature Coatings’ pigments are designed for industry. They are cost competitive. They are easy to use with existing equipment and water based formulas and do not require any upfront capital expenditure. Additionally, they stay far ahead of any global restricted substance lists, known as RSLs. Our pigments do not fade in the sun and do not “bronze” or turn brown at high or low concentrations. Our pigments are suitable for multiple applications including, but not limited to, screen printing, rotary printing, digital inkjet printing, coatings, dope dye, airbrush, resin casting and wood coloring.\n","HQ_Locality":"Los Angeles","HQ_Region":"California","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":"1-10","Organization_Type":"Private","Homepage":"https://naturecoatingsinc.com/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/naturecoatingsinc/","Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/1be6f72ab04617807e894426ce2b34ce/91bed/0e1587600000vbetatBbfs1hSaGctzyGIejNiXNU61MpjKb1w7CSinI2Yqlb8.png"}}}]},"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/0664c4efa6bfaffeb0168d779e821ebb/naturecoatingsinc.com-3.jpeg"},{"publicURL":"/static/15350730bdaa49ec885e078e939f03bd/naturecoatingsinc.com-2.jpeg"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":[{"id":"2249860d-9f58-556f-84c2-06e6776ea4f4","data":{"Name":"Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU)","Parent":[{"id":"3739898c-dc58-57eb-b31d-83dd96e55529","data":{"Name":"Community Development"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3c573cac-6975-5ace-a8c6-96a0ed4fb7a3"}}}
