Nearly all of this hydrogen is produced from steam methane reformation, which is reasonably efficient but is responsible for ~2% of all global carbon dioxide emissions. This $130B market is expected to grow to $180B by 2023.\n\nOur approach to producing industrial hydrogen is unique, and allows us to deliver carbon-neutral or carbon-negative hydrogen reliably and cost-effectively. To do this we've integrated a specially-chosen biomass crop, tightly coordinated farm operations, and a novel gasification system.\n\nOur engineering team is based in San Francisco, with operations in both California and central Louisiana.","HQ_Locality":"San Francisco","HQ_Region":"California","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":"1-10","Organization_Type":"Private","Homepage":"https://www.charmindustrial.com/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/charm-industrial/","Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/charm-industrial","Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/1862e74d3eda4bf82999607b77f4240a/91bed/016.png"}}}]},"fullPhotos":{"localFiles":[{"publicURL":"/static/e55337306a7f71a851133a50bb2232a6/www.charmindustrial.com-1.jpeg"}]},"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/803d6267cd32de38cccc2f35d5ab0dd5/91bed/d7yypu7jddydxvvuywgu.png"}}}]}}}],"Categories":[{"id":"49265904-91a5-5e82-b9d6-bf653d722c67","data":{"Name":"Hydrogen","Parent":[{"id":"65fa3a2f-5983-5ab9-8e30-201aba580a51","data":{"Name":"Energy"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"88b7c675-74a4-5db8-81ff-58b4c3872352"}}}
