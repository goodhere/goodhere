That's why we've invented a proprietary seed vessel that boosts survival rates. Now there is a a go-to contingency plan to quickly restore thousands of acres of wildfire ravaged land starting in 30 days.\n​\n​We understand that forestry is complicated. Sometimes you need tree-planters, sometimes you need helicopters. DroneSeed is the sweet spot in-between. Keep the speed, boost the survival of seed, and do it affordably and at scale. We load thousands of seed vessels at a time into our FAA heavy-lift certified drone swarms, each aircraft planting 3/4 of an acre per flight, or 57lbs.\n\nWe're a team of silviculturists: nursery managers, foresters, ecologists, biologists, and engineers. We love the data, theory, and the hands-on work necessary to grow forests. We understand land owner objectives. We work with 3 of the 5 largest timber companies in the world and The Nature Conservancy. Our customers trust us on-site to do our work independently, safely, in compliance, and on time.","HQ_Locality":"Seattle","HQ_Region":"Washington","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":"11-50","Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://www.droneseed.com/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/droneseed","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/DroneSeed","Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/droneseed/","Crunchbase":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/droneseed","Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/b26651f14105537a6dbc4c920735df4d/91bed/Imagefromwww.linkedin.comon2020-03-26at7.27.05PM.png"}}}]}}}],"Crunchbase_ODM":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/774678d8fcb594918f512e4b75f1a742/91bed/zajnzv0mgioar8sg3yke.png"}}}]}}}],"Categories":[{"id":"cf5d6277-d014-5570-a6b9-11083b4d1530","data":{"Name":"Forestry","Parent":[{"id":"3739898c-dc58-57eb-b31d-83dd96e55529","data":{"Name":"Carbon"}}]}}],"Source":[{"data":{"Name":"Climate Tech List","URL":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12xd_rY-WJo_QDxTkD1BfxzX9P4CwWCV5tAic7ELp4fo/edit#gid=0"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1f330855-da63-57f8-918e-1f1a4dd7601e"}}}
