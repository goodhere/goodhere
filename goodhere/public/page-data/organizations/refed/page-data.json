ReFED takes a data-driven approach to move the food system from acting on instinct to insights to solve our national food waste problem. Solutions already exist to cut food waste by 20% nationwide. ReFED has identified 27 of the best opportunities through the Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste, a first-of-its-kind economic analysis, making it easier for stakeholders across the food supply chain to meet the national 50% reduction goal by 2030. The ReFED Roadmap revolutionized the way the industry looks at food waste -- looking beyond challenges and identifying concrete opportunities to save money and resources, feed people, and create jobs. ReFED’s continued efforts include promoting date label standardization through a multi-stakeholder initiative; collecting data and generating insights on the innovation taking place to reduce food waste; and centralizing food waste policies at the state and Federal level.
