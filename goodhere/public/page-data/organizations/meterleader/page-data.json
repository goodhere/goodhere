MeterLeader allows users to easily create and participate in customizable energy saving challenges that are integrated with real-time energy data (currently PG&E energy data). We motivate users to save energy in their homes and buildings by using proven social science principles shown to achieve up to 27% in energy savings. We are like a Fitbit challenge, but instead of steps we measure kWh and carbon emissions reduced. \n\nIn minutes you can create a free energy savings challenge for your office, community, family, building, etc. or you can join one of MeterLeader's quarterly challenges.
