We empower all individuals with the tools they need to create and invest directly in to climate solution projects, like community solar. By creating new investment pathways open to anyone, we seek to democratize the ownership and benefits of the clean energy and climate-resilient infrastructure of the future. There is a gap in the ability of community based organizations like schools, churches, community centers, non-profits, and small businesses to get financing for solar and renewable energy projects. We offer a toolkit -- an Originator Packet -- for these types of organizations to develop and finance these types of projects. We then pair these projects with individuals or institutions that want to do small to medium scale impact investing in support of these organizations. Raise Green takes advantage of recent regulatory changes that open up the opportunity for non-accredited individuals to invest directly into private project finance companies that can accelerate the deployment of clean energy in a socially and financially inclusive way.","HQ_Locality":"Somerville","HQ_Region":"Massachusetts","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":"1-10","Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"http://www.raisegreen.com/","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/raisegreen/","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/raisegreeninc","Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/RaiseGreenInc/","Crunchbase":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/raise-green","Role":["Capital"],"Capital_Profile":[{"data":{"ImpactSpecific":true,"Strategic":null,"Stage":null,"CheckSize":null,"CapitalType":[{"data":{"Name":"Project Finance"}}]}}],"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/5d7ef6013dc9b8e0083be1de852de1b4/91bed/Imagefromwww.linkedin.comon2020-03-26at7.42.40PM.png"}}}]}}}],"Crunchbase_ODM":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/024ed131a4515767c4eebfee053417b5/91bed/qxhkehgcckxpd5afhm4g.png"}}}]}}}],"Categories":[{"id":"65fa3a2f-5983-5ab9-8e30-201aba580a51","data":{"Name":"International","Parent":null}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"86827bf3-52e7-55be-983c-d224556829a2"}}}
