We provide easy access to transparent grid carbon data, intelligence, and app, empowering individuals, organizations, and policy makers to better track, understand, and optimize grid emissions.\n\nLeveraging the newly available real-time data and state-of-the-art machine learning/AI techniques, we're inventing novel and practical approaches to visualize, learn, and co-optimize real-time energy usage and carbon footprints. Our solution will bring real-time visibility of energy and sustainability data with increased transparency, enable proactive energy/carbon monitoring and co-optimization, and provide better impact engagement.\n\nWe are a group of passionate smart grid researchers/engineers and experienced energy/IoT industry veterans. Leveraging technology developed at Harvard University, the team aims to commercialize next-generation, real-time data-driven energy + sustainability management technologies.","HQ_Locality":"Somerville","HQ_Region":"Massachusetts","HQ_Country":"United States","Headcount":null,"Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://www.singularity.energy/","LinkedIn":null,"Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/singularity-energy","Role":["Products & Services"],"Capital_Profile":null,"Logo":null,"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":[{"data":{"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/c891ea35c98d1f1f70dba2166533468a/91bed/lmp85bhaxf8i8fxodfzs.png"}}}]}}}],"Categories":[{"id":"7b100741-6239-5f50-8f3d-8f135ac998c1","data":{"Name":"Smart Grid","Parent":[{"id":"65fa3a2f-5983-5ab9-8e30-201aba580a51","data":{"Name":"International"}}]}}],"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"551beb1c-7df8-576d-9c88-2dc4013d1039"}}}
