Globally, they’re receiving $250 Billion in investment per year.\n\n–\nAs the price of solar, wind, and storage plunge, they become increasingly attractive – and increasingly disruptive to the existing industry.\n\n–\nI invest in early stage startups that are part of this transition. I lead syndicates where other accredited investors can invest alongside me. These startups are high-risk, high-reward. Many – even most – will not return the capital invested in them. Others may return 10x, 100x, or more.\n\n–\nIf you’re a startup seeking investment, or an accredited investor interested in co-investing, please contact me.","HQ_Locality":null,"HQ_Region":null,"HQ_Country":null,"Headcount":null,"Organization_Type":null,"Homepage":"https://rameznaam.com/investing/","LinkedIn":null,"Twitter":null,"Facebook":null,"Crunchbase":null,"Role":["Capital"],"Capital_Profile":[{"data":{"ImpactSpecific":null,"Strategic":null,"Stage":null,"CheckSize":null,"CapitalType":[{"data":{"Name":"Angels"}}]}}],"Logo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/5d38011a1e1f9c0dd6a0d9c99512d4ed/09d8f/aDT2MGoK_400x400.jpg"}}}]},"fullPhotos":null,"LinkedIn_Profiles":null,"Crunchbase_ODM":null,"Categories":null,"Source":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6a2ecfa8-558f-5fe4-99fd-8ef93c98df9d"}}}
